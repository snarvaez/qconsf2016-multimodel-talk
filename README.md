Presentation: The Rise of the Multi-Model Database
Track: Sponsored Solutions Track III
Duration: 1:40pm - 2:30pm
Persona:Developer

Abstract
The rigidness of monolithic applications and single datastores created the need for flexible architectures, such as micro-services and a myriad of alternative data technologies. As software engineers adopted this trend they found themselves with the symptom of “the embarrassment of riches”, having to onboard and support too many technologies, and even introducing additional management tools. As an answer, datastores are adapting and becoming as multifaceted as the needs of their consumers.

This session is aimed at developers that are building modern applications, where fast delivery and agility are critical, but are tired of supporting different technologies that slow their velocity. We will explore how modern datastores can fulfill many different use cases, improve speed and scale, and reduce operational overhead.
